/**
 * Creates an executor service that runs each task in the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute/submit}, as in {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}  This
 * applies both to individually submitted tasks and to collections of tasks
 * submitted via {@code invokeAll} or {@code invokeAny}.  In the latter case,
 * tasks will run serially on the calling thread.  Tasks are run to
 * completion before a {@code Future} is returned to the caller (unless the
 * executor has been shutdown).
 *
 * <p>Although all tasks are immediately executed in the thread that
 * submitted the task, this {@code ExecutorService} imposes a small
 * locking overhead on each task submission in order to implement shutdown
 * and termination behavior.
 *
 * <p>The implementation deviates from the {@code ExecutorService}
 * specification with regards to the {@code shutdownNow} method.  First,
 * "best-effort" with regards to canceling running tasks is implemented
 * as "no-effort".  No interrupts or other attempts are made to stop
 * threads executing tasks.  Second, the returned list will always be empty,
 * as any submitted task is considered to have started execution.
 * This applies also to tasks given to {@code invokeAll} or {@code invokeAny}
 * which are pending serial execution, even the subset of the tasks that
 * have not yet started execution.  It is unclear from the
 * {@code ExecutorService} specification if these should be included, and
 * it's much easier to implement the interpretation that they not be.
 * Finally, a call to {@code shutdown} or {@code shutdownNow} may result
 * in concurrent calls to {@code invokeAll/invokeAny} throwing
 * RejectedExecutionException, although a subset of the tasks may already
 * have been executed.
