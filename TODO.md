#Things to do Next
=================
- look at the performance of the "just Detect to parent" and "detect to anyone in the row above me" Treefill variants
- clean up the IO (Sender and Receiver) issues occurring on Brian's instances in the Twitter datacentre currently
- Metrics! Graphs! Comparisons!
- I would like to compare explicitly to whatever we can get -- if Amazon or Google have rate limiting open source work available, that would be really interesting to see

##Show off this work when it's done
- Brian / paper with Kim (author of original treefill paper)
- discuss our (not exactly what is in the Kim paper... it's pretty different in some ways) treefill implementations in a paper and maybe submit to https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/call-for-papers for 2019 or similar
- Engineering blog post once this thing is running in prod
