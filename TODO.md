#Things to do Next
=================
- look at the performance of the "just Detect to parent" and "detect to anyone in the row above me" Treefill variants
- clean up the IO (Sender and Receiver) issues occurring on Brian's instances in the Twitter datacentre currently
- Metrics! Graphs! Comparisons!
- I would like to compare explicitly to whatever we can get -- if Amazon or Google have rate limiting open source work available, that would be really interesting to see
- get the ReLogo sim stuff working with the new Treefill code and/or find something that doesn't require Eclipse to use additionally
- implement as per the paper, if it's possible to do that given the paper assumes 0-latency communication, at the very least structure-wise (so we can show Before and After!)

##Show off this work when it's done
- Brian / paper with Kim (author of original treefill paper)
- discuss our (not exactly what is in the Kim paper... it's pretty different in some ways) treefill implementations in a paper and maybe submit to https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/call-for-papers for 2019 or similar
- Engineering blog post once this thing is running in prod
