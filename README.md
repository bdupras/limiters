limiters
========
*NOTE:* top commit is work-in-progress and is a non-functional mess. `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to see the most recent buggy but almost functional version.


Not for public use. This is a protoyping repo for implementing various distributed rate limiting algorithms.

The main focus right now is the treefill algorithm described in the paper ["An optimal distributed trigger counting algorithm for large-scale networked systems"][1].


algorithms
----------

### treefill
- almost functional, but not quite yet

##### what works
- message passing & processing of Detect, Full, and WindowFull
- message transport layer abstracted for testing & simulation purposes
- nodes self-calculate their role in the tree (no observer/god role required)
- nodes independently increment their round counters

#### limitataions
- implementation assumes a perfect tree of nodes
- not fault tolerant yet

#### bugs / not working yet
- misunderstanding in the way the leaf node detectors are allocated 
  - too many Detects are generated before WindowFull is broadcast
  - all nodes particiapte in the detect tree
  - number of Detect slots is tied to the dimensions of the tree and cluster size and doesn't match what's really needed


##### pending refactors & features
- lots of renaming
  - karytree to karitytree
- datastructures are overly verbose to provide high visibility in initial code design and debugging; can be made far more efficient when the whole thing functions properly and passes tests
- support arbitrary cluster sizes
- support fault tolerance and rolling deployments
  - replace single root node with some form of virtualized/distributed root node
  - rearrange karitytree to be depth-first
